Program Assignment 4 - The Full Monty

Submitted via account: `cssc1015`

Unlike the it Broadway show, this program is decidingly less attractive than a Chippendale. However, it will keep all of it's clothes on, and won't put you in an awkward position with your significant other. Provided that your keyboard is not soaked in Cola or some other beverage, this program will assemble any and all SIC/XE source files, provided the entire contents of the file can be loaded into memory on the executing machine.
